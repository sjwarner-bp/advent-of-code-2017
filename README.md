# Advent of Code 2017

To practise for my upcoming OCAJP8 exam later this month, I am taking part in advent of code 2017!

Obviously, this means that my AoC this year will be mainly in Java.

Feel free to use my solutions if you are stuck, and follow along with the fun yourself [here](http://adventofcode.com/2017)!
